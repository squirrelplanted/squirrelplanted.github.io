Welcome! I've never had a blog before, but after the fifth friend says "maybe you should write a blog" a smart person has to take notice. I wasn't sure how to take the suggestions at first, because while it's possible that (a) my friends like what I share and think it would be great if I shared with more people, my brain also submited scenario (b) my friends are getting tired of listening to my random interests and think it would be great if I _shared them with other people_.

Either way the message was clear, the time has come to digitize my garden journal. If you're here reading this, maybe you have a garden journal too? It's the place where you channel your inner [Beatrix Potter](https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/07/28/beatrix-potter-a-life-in-nature-botany-mycology-fungi/
) - attempting (and if you're me, often failing) to capture some of the beautiful things around us.

Or maybe your journal is where you keep track of what you planted last year, and make plans for what you'll be planting this year. My journal has grid paper with scaled mock ups of the plots of land I have access to. I'm constantly overlaying things onto it like a land sized version of a paper doll, trying out this fruit tree and that, looking at hypothetical mature canopy covers and inserting imaginary successional plants for the intervening years.

My journal contains so much history, so it scares me to think how easily it could be destroyed or lost. Which brings us back to the blog, my plan is to bring the best ideas off the page and into this digital archive, not just so I can have text search (though I am *really* looking forward to that) but in the hopes that the info might be helpful to others.

So take a look around, I hope you find something helpful!
