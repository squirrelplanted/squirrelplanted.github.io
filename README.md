My personal blog for farm and garden things: http://squirrelplanted.com.

### Tech notes:
 * Fun read about the Google Photos URLs https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/23/8830977/google-photos-security-public-url-privacy-protected
 ** I'm still not clear on what exactly causes a url to expire when they haven't been right clicked though
 ** Experimenting with simulating right clicks to make the links last longer
