This past summer I got married at my parents farm, and hands down the best part of the preparations was creating what the family lovingly calls `the flower snake` or sometimes `the beastie`. The latter name sounds strange until you walk by it in person, the curves in its 200 foot length, coupled with the intense buzz of insects, and the ripples from the wind make this mound of flowers really seem like a living thing. Here are a few pictures to help set the stage (click for a larger view).

When my parents agreed to host the wedding I knew I wanted to plant wild flowers, but what we ended up with was more like an outdoor classroom, one that we'll be keeping alive for years to come. Below I'll share how we made this marvel (including lots of pictures), and mention a few things I'd do differently a second time around.

First, because a picture is worth a thousand words, take a look at this gallery (clicking on an image will make it bigger).

**Sheet mulching in a nutshell:** it's a low effort way of converting a grassy area into a garden. Instead of digging up the grass and moving it we just smother it with other organic materials and plant. The grass dies and decomposes under the weight and depth of the new mulch, and in death it makes rich fertilizer for whatever we've planted.

The actual Beastie materials list:
 * Cardboard
   * Enough to cover the area, allowing for 6 inches of overlap where pieces meet
     * The overlap is non-negogiable! Grass is resourceful, if you leave gaps it will grow right through and frolic in your garden
   * Don't mess around with flattening boxes, get the giant flat sheets that Costco puts between pallets
 * Soil
   * Enough to cover the cardboard to a depth of ~10 inches
     * I ordered 13 cubic yards based on an estimate of ~200 feet long x ~2 feet wide x 10 inches deep
   * I went with the cheapest soil I could find
     * I'm lucky that wildflowers by nature tend do well in crappy soil, because this stuff was mostly sand & bark
     * More soil thoughts below, but I would _not_ do the cheapest soil a second time around
 * Seeds   
   * I chose a [wildflower mix appropriate to my region](https://www.edenbrothers.com/store/pnw_wildflower_seed_mix.html)
   * And amended with a couple other favorites (nasturtiums mostly)

Just those three things (plus quite a bit of water, more on that below) made all of this.

Alternative materials:
 * Newspaper instead of cardboard
 * 

 Things I didn't do, but you really should:
