title: "The Squirrel Planted Mascot (aka, what's with the nasturtium?)"

Maybe you noticed my lovely nasturitum icon up top? It has a fun story I'd like to tell.

Like many urban gardeners I have shaken my fists in frustration at the bane of our existence - the city squirrel. They dig up our bulbs, they steal our tomatoes, and sometimes they eat through the wiring in our vehicles (true story, just like Mynocks on the Millennium Falcon). And yet, they are part of nature, and as I've taken steps down the regenerative agriculture, permaculture, we-are-all-connected-and-should-act-like-it path I was confronted with my hypocrisy. I can't be pissed off at another living thing for doing what it does, that isn't what Sepp would do, but what is it that squirrels do? In a natural system what is their benefit? Are they a city menace because they have no predators and we've built them a smörgåsbord?

I was pondering this one morning as I headed out my front door to work and my eye caught on this lovely nasturtium, coming up in a place in my yard where I definitely had *not* planted nasturtiums. Huh, my eyes scanned to the places where I had planted nasturtiums, they were pathetic spindly things that looked like they weren't getting enough light.
