In 2018 the female vine produced about ~6 fruits, we were able to eat most of them. I remember we shared one with Deepti and Nick on a weekend visit around November, then John and I ate the rest around the New Year. By the New Year the fruits were on the overripe side and one had split. I think that November or December would have been the perfect time to eat them.
