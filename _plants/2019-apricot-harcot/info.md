We picked out this tree as a potential candidate to live outside, the product description mentioned it was late blooming and resistant to diseases that are common to areas with lots of rain. Even so, I suspect that if we put it outside it will probably die (based on everybody else in the PNW having that same experience it seems), so when it comes to actual planting time I might choose to place this one in the greenhouse as well.
