The male kiwi vine is located at the base of the bird cherry trees, which makes it near-ish to the female vine, but not as close as I'd expect one to plant. The male vine may have become drought stressed in the summer of 2018, we noticed that it had browned and dropped many leaves. However, when cutting out some catepillar moths from the trees we found that the male vine still had a lot of leaves up in the canopy of those trees.
