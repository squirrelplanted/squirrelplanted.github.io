The unknown pears #2 and #3 seem like they could be the same cultivar, the fruit was similarly thin skinned and the flesh extremely juicy and delicious.

Tree #2 is the one closer to the driveway and the blueberry bushes. It is in a worse position due to shading from the other trees nearby. Tree #2 is not nearly as tall as #3.
