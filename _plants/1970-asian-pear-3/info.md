The unknown pears #2 and #3 seem like they could be the same cultivar, the fruit was similarly thin skinned and the flesh extremely juicy and delicious.

Tree #3 is the one further from the driveway. This tree is *very* tall, it ripened a lot of delicious fruit in 2018, but it is also casting quite a bit of shade.
